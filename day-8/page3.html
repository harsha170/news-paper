                <div class='corona'>
                   <b>Developer AstraZeneca said that COVID-19 vaccine will be supplied on a first-come, first-served basis.</b>
                </div>
                <div class="corona1">
                    United States President Donald Trump has ordered defence and health chiefs to ensure that America is the first one to procure UK's COVID-19 vaccine, being developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford.
                    This could mean that the US may buy all available doses of AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, leaving none for Britain.
                     Trump, who faces an election in November, has repeatedly said that enough doses of coronavirus vaccine will be made available for every American by April. He has also said that distribution of vaccine will begin within 24 hours of it being approved by federal health regulators.
                     "If the US regulator clears it first, they will get it first," an AstraZeneca spokesman told the UK tabloid.
                      United States has already secured almost a third of AstraZeneca's one billion possible COVID-19 vaccine doses by pledging up to $1.2 billion in May.
                      Trump has promised vaccine doses for every American under Operation Warp Speed plan, a multi-agency collaboration led by the US Health and Human Services, which aims at accelerating the development and manufacturing of medical countermeasures for COVID-19 and delivering 300 million doses of an effective vaccine by January 2021.
                      Meanwhile, the UK has contributed £84 million towards the vaccine, as per the report. Boris Johnson has also secured 100 million doses, but Britain could be left behind if US regulators give the go-ahead first.
                       vaccines in phase 3 trials include Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc.

                    WARANGAL: District officials want to utilise the huge revenues expected to be generated from the Land Regularisation Scheme (LRS) to take up development works in Warangal, under the Master Plan-2041.
                    As many as 71,000 property owners have applied for LRS under Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC) and Kakatiya Urban Development Authority (KUDA) limits.                   
                    Officials said that they have received nearly Rs 7.30 crore towards the registration fee, and that they are expecting to receive around Rs 500 crore more. Though the city has been witnessing rapid growth over the years, successive governments have failed to roll out a master plan to address the city’s needs. The KUDA finally came out with Master Plan-2041, which was approved by the State government. Now, the authorities want to focus on completing works detailed under the plan by utilising LRS revenues.                  
                    About 5-6 months ago, KUDA officials had conducted a one-month special mela for the Land Regularisation Scheme (LRS) in Warangal. During the mela, a total of 28,000 applications were registered, of which 22,000 were given a proceeding certificate. The KUDA generated revenues of nearly Rs 200 crore through the mela.
