            Several players haven’t lived up to the expectations and not delivered the desired results for their respective teams. Here we take a look at five of those players, who let the fans down with a string of bad performances.The Indian Premier League 2020 has crossed the halfway mark and we have witnessed some crazy moments so far this year. The league started with two Super Overs in the first week and several other close finishes. Despite IPL 2020 not being a run-fest, it is turning out to be the most exciting season so far with highly intense finishes in almost every game.
            So far, 37 league games have been played, and Delhi Capitals are leading the IPL 2020 Points Table with Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore following them. These three teams are almost certain to qualify for the play-offs. The remaining five teams are in contention for the fourth spot where Kolkata Knight Riders have a better chance of qualifying.Several players haven’t lived up to the expectations and not delivered.

        <div class='sports'>
            The new overlay of OnePlus' OxygenOS 11, is based on Android 11, and happens to be one of the first to be released in a stable version on the OnePlus 8T, recently on the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, and by the end of this year or sometime in early 2021 on the OnePlus 7, 7 Pro and 7T/7T Pro.OxygenOS 11 has gained a lot of attention and buzz since its beta release, especially among the US tech press for its unique position (which is weird since the OnePlus implementation of Android is far from being dominant in the US, but so be it).
            OnePlus has made the closeness of its interface to stock Android to be its trademark and a distinctive call card. And OxygenOS 11 therefore logically embeds the new features inaugurated in Android 11 such as bubble notifications, the Power Menu, the media player in the drop-down menu, etc.Samsung's OneUI remains the most popular software overlay on Android. But the relative 'lightness' of an interface that does not add too many elements to Google's OS while remaining as close as possible to what you can experience on a Pixel device remains a rather expensive option in the eyes of a significant part of users.

            In concrete terms, any changes made are essentially visual. OxygenOS 11 has undoubtedly embarked on the biggest graphic redesign in its recent history. Most starkly, the interface has been redesigned in terms of ergonomics, moving most of the information and touch controls to the bottom of the screen, which is naturally closer to your thumb's reach.
          As I mentioned in an article about compact smartphones, this change in visual identity responds to a need for users to be able to use their increasingly larger smartphones with just one hand, and in a more ergonomic manner.

On October 16, when the NTA had declared the result, it gave Mridul 329 points in 720. But after rechecking it was found that Mridul has obtained 650 out of 720 marks.
           According to Mridul, his All India rank in General Category is 3577.
            However, a mistake was also spotted by Mridul in the second marksheet issued by the NTA. In the second marksheet, the sum of of his marks shows 650 but only three hundred twenty-nine were written in words.
